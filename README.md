# Final Project for INFO 523 - Data Mining/Discovery

## (Fall '25 MS of DS @ University of Arizona)

---

### Project Description

 The goal of this project was to explore two data driven questions using the techniques we learned across the semester. The two questions I wanted to ask were:
    1. As the number of fuel efficient cars on the road increases and vehicle registrations decrease, will that affect future fuel consumption across the U.S.?
       * This question is based upon the INFO 511 project that I completed earlier in the semester and the ideas for improvements that I had.
    2. Do Gasoline and Diesel prices within the U.S. move in similar ways and based upon the movement of one, can we predict the other?
